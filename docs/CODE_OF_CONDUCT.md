# Our Promise for a Friendly Evy Community

We want everyone in our Evy community to feel welcome and safe, no matter who
they are. This means everyone â€“ of any age, background, or how much coding
experience you have.

We promise to be kind, respectful, and work together to make Evy a place where
everyone feels like they belong.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is based on a bigger set of rules called the [Contributor Covenant],
> which helps make sure communities are safe and welcoming. We took the most
> important parts and made them easy to understand, but all the original rules
> still apply too!

## How to Be a Great Community Member

- Be kind and understanding of others.
- Respect people with different ideas and experiences than your own.
- If someone gives you feedback, listen and try to learn from it.
- If you make a mistake, apologize and try to do better next time.
- Think about what helps the whole community, not just yourself.

## Things That Hurt Our Community

- Using mean words, hurtful images, or making fun of someone.
- Bullying, saying bad things, or attacking someone in person or online.
- Sharing someone's address or other private stuff without them saying it's OK.
- Any other behavior that would be considered inappropriate in a classroom setting.

## Who Helps Keep Things Safe

Our community leaders will make sure these rules are followed. If something
bad happens, they'll take action to fix it, and might have to give a warning
or even ask someone to leave if they're breaking the rules.

## How to Report a Problem

If you see something unkind or unsafe, tell a community leader! You can email
[evy@evy.dev] or message a leader with `@mods` on our [Evy Discord server]. We
promise to listen and help.
