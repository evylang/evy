//  Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
//  n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
//  are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
//  each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
//  when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
//  However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
//  in their trajectory as if they did not collide.
//
//  This function outputs the number of such collisions.
