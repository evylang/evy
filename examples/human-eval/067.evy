// In this task, you will be given a string that represents a number of apples and oranges
// that are distributed in a basket of fruit this basket contains
// apples, oranges, and mango fruits. Given the string that represents the total number of
// the oranges and apples and an integer that represent the total number of the fruits
// in the basket return the number of the mango fruits in the basket.
// for example:
// mangoCount "5 apples and 6 oranges" 19 // 19 - 5 - 6 = 8
// mangoCount "0 apples and 1 oranges"3 //  3 - 0 - 1 = 2
// mangoCount "2 apples and 3 oranges" 100 //  100 - 2 - 3 = 95
// mangoCount "100 apples and 1 oranges"120 //  120 - 100 - 1 = 19
