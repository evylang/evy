// I think we all remember that feeling when the result of some long-awaited
// event is finally known. The feelings and thoughts you have at that moment
// are definitely worth noting down and comparing. Your task is to determine
// if a person correctly guessed the results of a number of matches. You are
// given two arrays of scores and guesses of equal length, where each index
// shows a match. Return an array of the same length denoting how far off
// each guess was. If they have guessed correctly, the value is 0, and if
// not, the value is the absolute difference between the guess and the
// score.
// example:
// compare [1 2 3 4 5 1] [1 2 3 4 2 -2] // [0 0 0 0 3 3]
// compare [0 5 0 0 0 4] [4 1 1 0 0 -2] // [4 4 1 0 0 6]
