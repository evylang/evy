// You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of
// carrots, but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
// you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your
// meals, the number of carrots left after your meals ] if there are not
// enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will
// still be hungry.
// Example:
// eat 5  6 10 // [11 4]
// eat 4  8 9 // [12 1]
// eat 1  10 10 // [11 0]
// eat 2  11 5 // [7 0]
// Parameters:
// done : the number of carrots that you have eaten.
// need : the number of carrots that you need to eat.
// stock : the number of remaining carrots that exist in stock
