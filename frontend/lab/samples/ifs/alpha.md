## [>] Docs

In the interactive [`hsl`] function [color explorer](#hsl) we learned how hsl
takes three values: hue, saturation, lightness values to create a color.

There is an optional fourth value called **alpha** that controls the
transparency of the color. The alpha value ranges from `0` to `100`, where `0`
is fully transparent and `100` is fully opaque.
