# 🌈 Transparent Colors

⭐ **Read** and **Run** the code. Does it make sense to you?

⭐ **Complete it** to create the following drawing:

⭐ **Modify the Alpha** parameter to the [`hsl`] function to make the bottom

## [>] Understanding Alpha 📖

In the interactive [`hsl`] function [color explorer](#hsl) we learned how hsl
takes three values: hue, saturation, lightness values to create a color.

There is an optional fourth value called **alpha** that controls the
transparency of the color. The alpha value ranges from `0` to `100`, where `0`
is fully transparent and `100` is fully opaque.
