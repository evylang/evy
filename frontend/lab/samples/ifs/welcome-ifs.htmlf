<h1>👋 Welcome to the <code>if</code> Lab</h1>
<p>Hit <strong>Run</strong> to see a blue, pulsing shape 🧿👉.</p>
<p>This is what we'll build in this lab!</p>
<p>
  The <code>if</code> statement is key here. It lets your code make decisions, adding logic and
  interactivity.
</p>
<p>
  ⭐ Observe the animation. What kind of <em>decisions</em> would the code need to make while it's
  running to create the pulsing effect?
