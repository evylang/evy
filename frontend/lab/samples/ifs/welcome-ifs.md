# 👋 Welcome to the `if` Lab

Hit **Run** to see a blue, pulsing shape 🧿👉.

This is what we'll build in this lab!

The `if` statement is key here. It lets your code make decisions, adding logic
and interactivity.

⭐ Observe the animation. What kind of _decisions_ would the code need to make
while it's running to create the pulsing effect?

## [>] Hint

Focus on when the animation changes direction.
