# 💫 Loops

Can you change this program to

- ⭐️ `print` the numbers from `0` to `20`?
- ⭐️ `sleep` only `0.2` seconds?

# [>] Understanding Loops 📖

A loop in programming is a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks. In Evy, a loop is created
using the `while` keyword.

Here's the basic structure:

```evy
while loop_condition
    loop_body
    // …
end
```

- `while`: Start of the loop.
- **loop_condition**: As long as this condition is true, the loop repeats.
- **loop_body**: Instructions to be repeated.
- `end`: End of the loop.
