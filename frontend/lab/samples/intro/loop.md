A **loop** in programming is a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks. In
Evy, a loop is created using the `while` keyword.

Here's the basic structure:

```evy
while loop_condition
    loop_body
    // ‚Ä¶
end
```

- `while`: Start of the loop.
- **loop_condition**: As long as this condition is true, the loop repeats.
- **loop_body**: Instructions to be repeated.
- `end`: End of the loop.
