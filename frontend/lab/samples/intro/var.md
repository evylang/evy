## ⭐ Intro

_Don't run the code yet!_

- What will the first two [`print`] commands show?

In Evy, we create a variable and its type with the pattern:

```evy
name:type
```

Let's _declare_ the variable `x`, which can only store a number value:

```evy
x:num
```

Now we can _assign_ a value to it using the equality sign `=`:

```evy
x = 3 + 4
```

📌 A variable _must_ be declared before it can be used.
