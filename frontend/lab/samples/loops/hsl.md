It's a way to describe how colors are created.

## ðŸ§ª Experiment!

- **Run** the program.
- **Tap** the canvas.
- **Observe** how changing the HSL values affects the color.

**Hue** is the color type, like red, green, or blue. It is a number between
`0` and `360` degrees.

**Saturation** is the intensity of the color. It is a number between
`0` and `100` percent. Optional, default `100`.

**Lightness** is the brightness of the color. It is a number between
`0` and `100` percent. Optional, default `50`.

**Alpha** is the transparency of the color. It is a number between
`0` and `1`. Optional, default `1`.
