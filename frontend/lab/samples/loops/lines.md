‚≠ê Can you do it using a loop?

## [>] Hint

```evy
while x < ‚ùì
    move ‚ùì
    line ‚ùì
    x = x + ‚ùì
end
```

‚≠ê Can you make the step `10` a variable and run the program with different step
values?

## [>] Hint

```evy
step = ‚ùì
while x < __
    // ...
    x = x + ‚ùì
end
```

## [>] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Animation!

Add a second, wrapping, outer loop that ranges over the `step` variable.

- Set `step` to `10` at the beginning
- Reduce the `step` variable by `-0.05`.
- Keep looping as long as `step` is greater then `2`
- Use the `clear` command.
- Use the `sleep 0.01` command.
- Reset the position variable `x` to `0`.
