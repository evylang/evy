# ðŸŽ¯ Target board

Hit **Run** to draw an animated target board.

How would you go about writing this program?

## [>] Hint

- Break down the problem into smaller bits.
- Create a static image that fits on the canvas:
  ![target board](samples/loops/img/target.svg)
- Animate the circles with the <code>sleep</code> command.
- Increase the starting radius to cover the whole canvas.
