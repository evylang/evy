  Programming is for everyone! You don't have to have a specific background or education. You just
  need curiosity and the willingness to try.

  In this course, you'll learn how to make the computer follow your instructions one by one,
  creating your first graphics! You'll work with different types of data like numbers and text, and
  even teach your programs to make choices and repeat actions.
