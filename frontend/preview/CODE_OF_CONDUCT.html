      <h1>Our Promise for a Friendly Evy Community</h1>
      <p>
        We want everyone in our Evy community to feel welcome and safe, no matter who they are. This
        means everyone – of any age, background, or how much coding experience you have.
      </p>
      <p>
        We promise to be kind, respectful, and work together to make Evy a place where everyone
        feels like they belong.

        <p>
          [!IMPORTANT] This guide is based on a bigger set of rules called the
          <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html"
            >Contributor Covenant</a
          >, which helps make sure communities are safe and welcoming. We took the most important
          parts and made them easy to understand, but all the original rules still apply too!

        Our community leaders will make sure these rules are followed. If something bad happens,
        they'll take action to fix it, and might have to give a warning or even ask someone to leave
        if they're breaking the rules.
