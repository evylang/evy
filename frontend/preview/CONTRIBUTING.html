        >Contribute to the Codebase
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to keep Evy's codebase as clear and understandable as the language itself. Evy
        is designed to be a learning experience in every way ‚Äì including how the code itself is
        written. Our main goal is to make programming accessible and inviting, and we believe the
        project's code should reflect that. This means we need to be disciplined and thoughtful when
        making changes to the Evy repository, starting with how we put together commit messages and
        pull requests.
      </p>
      <h3><a id="commit-messages" href="#commit-messages" class="anchor">#</a>Commit Messages</h3>
      <p>Structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Title</strong>: component: Verb phrase completing &quot;This change modifies Evy
          to...&quot;
        </li>
        <li><strong>Body</strong>: Explain the WHY and WHAT, wrap lines at 72 characters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre><code>vm: Create vm package

Create a vm package that executes bytecode created by the compiler. Currently
it can only support the simplest evy program: an inferred type declaration
from a constant, followed by an assignment. We are putting structure in place
here which we will expand.

        Your PR description becomes the merge commit message when your PR is merged. Take the same
        care with it as you do with your commit messages!

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tell a Story:</strong> Use multiple commits to break your changes into logical
          steps. Each step should work on its own (make ci will check this!).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tidy History:</strong> Before submitting, clean up your commits. This makes it
          easier for reviewers to follow your thought process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Catch Your Own Mistakes:</strong> Do a self-review before asking others. It'll
          save everyone time!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> You're presenting your work. Clear, organized work is
        easier to understand and helps reviewers give you the best feedback possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use a
        <a href="https://github.com/foxygoat/git-scripts/blob/master/git-pr-merge">merge script</a>
        that formats the merge commits and adds an emoji - this is for the merge commit only. To see
        examples, run the following commands on the evy repo:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>git log --oneline</code></li>
        <li><code>git log --oneline --graph</code> shows the structure more clearly and</li>
        <li><code>git log --oneline --first-parent</code> shows merge-commits / PR titles only</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have non-permanent comments in the PR description, e.g.: &quot;This PR is temporarily
        deployed at <a href="https://evystage.dev%22">https://evystage.dev&quot;</a>, post them past
        a <code>---</code>, those sections do not get copied into the merge commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <code>Fixes</code> or <code>Updates</code> keywords with issue numbers after
        <code>---</code> in your PR description to automatically close or reference GitHub issues.
      </p>
      <h3><a id="go-code" href="#go-code" class="anchor">#</a>Go code</h3>
      <p>
        Try to follow the best practices outlined
        <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments">Go Code Review Comments</a> and
        <a href="https://go.dev/doc/effective_go">Effective Go</a>.

      <h4>
        <a id="godoc-comments-in-code" href="#godoc-comments-in-code" class="anchor">#</a>godoc
        comments in code
      </h4>
      <p>Wrap at 72 char.</p>
      <h4><a id="filenames" href="#filenames" class="anchor">#</a>Filenames</h4>
      <p>
        Don't use <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> in _.go file names unless used with intention,
        e.g. <code>_\_test.go</code>, <code>\*\_unix.go</code>, <code>\_ignoreme.go</code>.
      </p>
      <h4><a id="code-style" href="#code-style" class="anchor">#</a>Code style</h4>
      <p>
        Don't use line breaks within function call (on commas), try and fit one function call on one
        line. No need for line wrapping of go code - one line is one idea; a function call is one
        idea. If for whatever reasons it really does feel too long, break it up in a different way,
        e.g. assign parameters to variables first. Occasional lines with 120 characters are fine.
        Map and array literals can be split over multiple lines, preferably only in assignments or
        inferred declarations.
      </p>
      <h4><a id="testing" href="#testing" class="anchor">#</a>Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Ideally <code>TestSomething</code> is a self-contained function, so that tests can be read
        without much jumping around - it's ok if these functions get big, they are usually quite
        linear. Helpers with <code>t.Helper()</code> don't report where the error happened so they
        should conceptually be a single assertion and also called that e.g.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-go">func assertNumValue(t *testing.T, want float64, got Value) {
  t.Helper()
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
