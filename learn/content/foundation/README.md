# ðŸŒ± Foundation

Programming is for everyone! You don't have to have a specific background or
education. You just need curiosity and the willingness to try.

In this course, you'll learn how to make the computer follow your instructions
one by one, creating your first graphics! You'll work with different types of
data like numbers and text, and even teach your programs to make choices and
repeat actions.

Let's get started! ðŸš€
