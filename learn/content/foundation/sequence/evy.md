# Evy

Evy is a programming language that helps you learn how to code. It's made for
people who are just starting out, and it has simple rules that make it easy
to understand.

## Evy website

You can try it out on the Evy web [playground], where you can choose from a
variety of examples to get you started. If you have some programming
experience, you may also find the [Syntax by Example] or the
[Language Specification] helpful.

Write your code on the left. Click `Run` to see the output on the right,
including any text or drawings that your code generates.
