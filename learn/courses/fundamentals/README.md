# Course: Fundamentals

`{{course-overview-widget:fundamentals}}`

## [Unit 1: Sequential Execution](seq/README.md)

In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 2: Types and Variables](type/README.md)

Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 3: Introduction to flow control](flow/README.md)

Ifs and loops. Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 4: Operators](op/README.md)

Operators. Equality, comparison, arithmetic, concatenation.
Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 5: Strings and number in detail](string/README.md)

Operators. Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 6: bool and if](bool/README.md)

Not, and, or Operators. Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.

## [Unit 7: arrays and for-loops](for/README.md)

Operators (+,\*). Variables and Types. In coding, your instructions are like a recipe - the computer follows them one by one, making sure each step happens in the right order.
