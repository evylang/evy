Complete this program

    print "Hello" ___

to create the following output:

    Hello Cam

Choose the most [direct and simple] answer.

[direct and simple]: /definitions#simple-and-direct

We are looking for the most straight forward and typically shortest answer to
fill the blank. There is no precise definition for "most direct and simple".
At times it requires a bit of good judgement and taste like many choices in
programming and that's another skill we'd like to help develop.

Take this question for example: complete this program to generate the output
`2`:

    a := 1 + ___
    print a

Correct answers are: `1`, `3+2-4`, `(str2num "1")`, and many others.
The accepted answer will be `1`.
